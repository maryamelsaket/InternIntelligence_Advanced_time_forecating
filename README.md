# InternIntelligence_Advanced_time_forecating_with_prophet
This project focuses on identifying anomalies in sales data and forecasting future trends using two time-series models: **Prophet** and **ARIMA**. It combines statistical analysis, visualizations, and model performance tracking for better insight into sales patterns.

## üìÅ Project Overview

- **Anomaly Detection:** Z-score, IQR, and rolling bounds methods.
- **Temporal Pattern Analysis:** Breakdown of anomalies by weekday and month.
- **Geographic Breakdown:** Store-level performance insights.
- **Forecasting Models:**
  - **Prophet**: With seasonality, holidays, and external regressors (oil prices).
  - **ARIMA**: Auto-optimized using `auto_arima`.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Rolling RMSE and MAPE metrics.
  - Residual analysis (distribution, ACF, QQ plots).
  - Time-based cross-validation.
- **Model Persistence:** Saved using `.pkl` for deployment/reuse.
